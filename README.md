### Title

Eat-Da-Burger

### Description

I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.The MVC design pattern was followed. This was quite a challenge from previous assignments, as it was difficult to figure out who was talking to who. What helped the most with this assignment was helping others figure out their coding issues. Additionally, I had to connect to a Heroku database, which did not give me any problems, as I followed the instructions, but it was a challenge non the less. * Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. * Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. * The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. * I also added a delete button, which was not required, so that burgers can be deleted from the right side of the page, so the list does not get to long. When these burgers are deleted, they are deleted from the database as well.
